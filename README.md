Running the program is simple and the terminal will tell you what to do


When it asks you for an equation it is very specific on using numpy supported formatting.
Here is a list of common supported equations.

1. Power / Polynomial
   - x**2 + 3*x + 5       → Quadratic function

2. Trigonometric
   - sin(x)               → Sine function (in radians)
   - cos(x) + 2           → Cosine function
   - 2*sin(x)**2          → Sine squared

3. Exponential
   - exp(x)               → e^x
   - exp(-x**2)           → Gaussian curve

4. Logarithmic
   - log(x)               → Natural log (ln)

5. Constants
   - pi                   → Pi (≈ 3.1416)
